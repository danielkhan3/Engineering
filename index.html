    <p><b><i><u>9/2/2022</u></i></b> - This week we played around with Tinker CAD
    and learned the basics. We use it for 3d modeling. 
    We did a fun challenge on Tinker CAD. 
    I made a pizza oven.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>9/9/2022</u></i></b> - We did some more with Tinker CAD. Also, we created a Tinker 
    CAD for our Rude Goldberg project. We had to make sure all the 
    dimensions correct for the project.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>9/16/2022</u></i></b> - This week we started our Rube Goldberg project.
    We also did a challenge where we had to make a boat by 
    only using paper and see how long the boat could float. Regaurding
    the project, we cut out cardboard and made a ramp.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>9/23/2022</u></i></b> - This week we did more improvements on the Goldberg
    project. We had added more parts to the car. We also tested our 
    project and it worked the first time. That was a big accomplishment.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>9/30/2022</u></i></b> - This week we had disected an old GUSD chromebook laptop.
    We had to identify the different components and take apart, then put back
    together the computer. We also had to fill in and color a model of the 
    inside of the laptop. It was quite enjoyable.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>10/14/2022</u></i></b> - This week we had learned about areospace engineering.
    We also learned about aeronautical engineering. We also started 
    creating a project on areospace engineering where we have to create 
    a bottle rocket.</p>
