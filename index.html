    <p>9/2/2022 - This week we played around with Tinker CAD
    and learned the basics. We use it for 3d modeling. 
    We did a fun challenge on Tinker CAD. 
    I made a pizza oven.</p>
    <p>9/16/2022 - This week we started our Rube Goldberg project.
    We also did a challenge where we had to make a boat by 
    only using paper and see how long the boat could float. Regaurding
    the project, we cut out cardboard and made a ramp.</p>
