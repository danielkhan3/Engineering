    <p><b><i><u>9/2/2022</u></i></b> - This week we played around with Tinker CAD
    and learned the basics. We use it for 3d modeling. 
    We did a fun challenge on Tinker CAD. 
    I made a pizza oven.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>9/9/2022</u></i></b> - We did some more with Tinker CAD. Also, we created a Tinker 
    CAD for our Rude Goldberg project. We had to make sure all the 
    dimensions correct for the project.</p>
    <img src = "C5.png" width = "200px" height = "100">
    <p><b><i><u>9/16/2022</u></i></b> - This week we started our Rube Goldberg project.
    We also did a challenge where we had to make a boat by 
    only using paper and see how long the boat could float. Regaurding
    the project, we cut out cardboard and made a ramp.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>9/23/2022</u></i></b> - This week we did more improvements on the Goldberg
    project. We had added more parts to the car. We also tested our 
    project and it worked the first time. That was a big accomplishment.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>9/30/2022</u></i></b> - This week we had disected an old GUSD chromebook laptop.
    We had to identify the different components and take apart, then put back
    together the computer. We also had to fill in and color a model of the 
    inside of the laptop. It was quite enjoyable.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>10/7/2022</u></i></b> - This week we made
    prosthetic animal limbs on TinkerCAD. I made a thing to help
    turtles with missing limbs that way they can walk. They sit
    on the flat part and use the limbs they have to push themselves
    to move.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>10/14/2022</u></i></b> - This week we had learned about 
    areospace engineering.We also learned about aeronautical engineering. 
    We also started creating a project on areospace engineering where we have 
    to create a bottle rocket.</p>
    <img src = "C7.png" width = "200px" height = "100">
    <p><b><i><u>10/21/2022</u></i></b> - This week we constructed 
    bottle rocket to launch on the field outside. Our rocket launch was
    not succussful. When we launched it, the rocket just tiped forward 
    and ignited when it was on the ground nose pointed down. We came to 
    the conclusion that our rockets front part was too heavy which was why
    it didn't work.</P>

    <p><b><i><u>10/27/2022</u></i></b> - This week we tried to make
    a filter to clean dirty water and make it clean. We used a 
    bottle, filled it with cotton at the tip and big rocks on top.
    Then in the middle, we added sand with smaller rock pebbels. We 
    then filled the bottle with dirty water and when clean water
    came out, that's when we knew it was working really well.</p>

    <p><b><i><u>11/4/2022</u></i></b> - This week we started learning about
    electrical engineering. We used TinkerCAD to create a model electrical
    circuit. We tested out and connected wire to turn on a light bulb. 
    The activity was at first a little difficult but once I understood the 
    concepts, it was fairly easy.</p>
    <img src = "C12.png" width = "300px" height = "200">
    <p><b><i><u>11/10/2022</u></i></b> - This week we experimented with 
    actual circuits and turned on light bulbs. We used different this to help
    us. We used a type of measuring tool that helped us measure Voltage and 
    the amount of resistance. It was a little confusing for me at first,
    however I quickly got a grasp on things. In the end, it was really 
    fun.</p>
    <img src = "C13.png" width = "200px" height = "200">
    <p><b><i><u>11/18/2022</u></i></b></p> - This week we experimented with
    an electrical engineering website. We used it to power our light bulb
    and see if the light would turn on. It was a very fun simulation and it
    was very excting to see how the different settings changed the light
    bulb color and brightness.

    <p><b><i><u>12/2/2022</u></i></b></p> - This week we had started
    our final project. It was making a spagehti bridge. We started Tinker 
    CADing it today. We made two iterations of our bridge. One with triangles
    and another that is kind of in the shape of a latter. The one on the
    left is the trinagle bridge and the one on the right is the latter.
    Out of the two, the triangles seemed that they were the more structurely
    stable one. Only because the base had more support compared to the other.

    <p><b><i><u>12/9/2022</u></i></b></p> - This week we had built the two 
    bridges from the previous week and we had been also able to test them 
    as well. They both required a lot of glue to keep them together. 
    It also took a lot of presice and careful cutting of the spagehti to get
    the bridge we wanted. In the end, our triangle bridge did not sucessfullly
    hold the cup of water we had. My hypothosis was incorrect unfourtanetly.
    The second bridge was the one that had lasted the longest out of the 
    two bridges. We asume the sides were the part of the bridge that 
    held it together the best. We had also been able to start another
    iteration of our bridge. The one with the spagehti going acroos similar to 
    the latter iteration. We had also started bridge and just clumped all of 
    the spagehti pieces together.

    <p><b><i><u>12/16/2022</u></i></b></p> - This week we had continued with
    spagehti project. We tested out the second type of latter bridge and this
    one suprisingly worked really well with the small plastic cup. But when we
    switched over to the ace hard plasic bucket, it broke. We had also been able
    to finish the clumped spagehti bridge that we started on the week before.
    We were then able to test it. It held around two to three cups of water. 
    The most out of all of them.

   <p><b><i><u>12/20/2022</u></i></b></p> - This week we completed our final
   project for the spagehti bridges. We ended up doing and reverting back to the
   bridge where we stuck all of the spagehti together. It held up the best under
   heavy weight. Even though it didn't look the best, it was very strong. Our
   bridge came in weighing at about 16 ounces. Our bridge carried around 60 to 
   61 ounces of water with the big red Ace bucket. That's around two cups of 
   water. In the end, one of the sides brocke of possibly because of not enough
   glue or lack of support. However I am still pleased with the results of the
   bridge.
